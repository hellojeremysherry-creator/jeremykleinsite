      <p>
        Thank you for taking the time to review my materials. This page gathers everything you may want
        to see in one place as you consider a potential Law Office Study Program apprenticeship.
      </p>
      <p>
        I recently completed my 1L year at Hofstra Law and returned home to the San Gabriel Valley to
        pursue California’s LOSP path. My first career was nearly fifteen years as a content producer,
        working closely with small and regulated businesses on clear communication and client service.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m especially interested in supporting family-owned and immigrant-run businesses with practical,
        day-to-day legal needs—contracts, employment questions, and operational risk.
      </p>
